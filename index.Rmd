I am a Masters in Public Health Candidate at [Columbia University Mailman School of public health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) with a certificate in Comparative effectiveness and outcomes research. 

I am interested in the intersection of epidemiology, health policy and health economics. Through my research I want to tackle issues related to resource allocation and address chronic disease conditions. 

My background is in dentistry and I advocate to bring issues related to burden of oral diseases into mainstream discussions at a global level.
